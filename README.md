# RocketPing - Silent Notification (still in production)

Minimal background app written in Flutter that will generate a live network speed test and return
the results of ping and mbps as a silent notification on android. Ideally, the app should run in
the background forever. Sending and receiving packets require very little resources and should have
an unnoticeable impact on this generation's smart phones. The results will refresh at the rate of
the users choice, allowing more control over the resources being used by the app.


What is the Ping tool? What is it used for?
The Ping tool is used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network. A Ping measures the time it takes for packets to be sent from the local host to a destination computer and back. The Ping tool measures and records the round-trip time of the packet and any losses along the way. - https://www.domaintools.com/support/what-is-the-ping-tool-what-is-it-used-for
